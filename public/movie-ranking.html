<h1>Best Movies According to Angelica</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is a Ghibli Film that I watched several years ago. Although this is a fiction movie, I can really say that it's the best movie I have seen so far.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>It's also a Ghibli film and it just gives me a happy feel. </p>
<h3>Odd Thomas</h3>
<p>I went to the mall with my college friends to watch some movie, and since were still students, we opt to watch a budget film. A budget film is an old movie that they play in the cinema for a cheaper price. With all of these being said, we didn't expect much from this film but it made us cry in the end. It became one of my favorite movies of all time.</p>
